## 📋 Project Overview

The Buddy System creates emotional engagement for young readers through animated digital companions. Children hatch buddies from eggs earned through reading milestones, customize them with accessories, and watch them react to progress with delightful animations.

### Key Features

- **🥚 Egg Hatching**: Progress-driven buddy unlocking system
- **🎭 Interactive Gestures**: Wave, jump, cheer animations with audio
- **👒 Customization**: Unlockable accessories and themes
- **📊 Progress Tracking**: Visual milestone progression
- **♿ Accessibility**: Screen reader support, reduced motion options
- **🔒 Privacy**: COPPA-compliant analytics with local storage

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Rive** for high-performance vector animations
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Context** for state management
- **LocalStorage** for progress persistence
