# Reading Buddies Rive - Project Context

## Overview
A web-based kids' reading platform featuring an animated "Buddy System" built with Rive animations. Children hatch, befriend, and customize animated buddies that react to reading progress and celebrate achievements.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED** - Complete Rive integration working! Kitten ninja character loads, animates, and responds to user interaction with dynamic canvas sizing.

**Repository**: üîí Private GitHub repo at https://github.com/travisgregory/reading-buddy-rive
- Git initialized and all code committed
- Authentication configured with personal access token
- Ready for collaborative development

## Documentation
- **PRD**: `/docs/buddy_system_prd_v2.md` - Product requirements and specification
- **README**: `/README.md` - Project overview and quick start guide
- **This File**: Development context and common commands

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Animation**: Rive (@rive-app/react-canvas)
- **Testing**: Vitest, @testing-library/react
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Formatting**: Prettier

## Key Features (From PRD)
- Egg hatching system for unlocking buddies
- Animated buddies with emotional states and gestures
- Accessory customization system
- Audio/voice lines synchronized with animations
- Progress tracking tied to reading milestones
- Offline support with IndexedDB

## Architecture Overview

### **Phase 2: Optimized Architecture (Current)**
- **React Context**: RiveProvider replaces singleton pattern for better React integration
- **Manager Classes**: Dependency injection with Context instead of global singletons
- **React Hooks**: useBuddy, useEggProgress for component state management
- **Component Isolation**: BuddyCanvas with proper separation of concerns
- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy + Suspense for performance optimization
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with strict configuration

### **Core Patterns**
- **Context Pattern**: Global Rive state management through React Context
- **Manager Pattern**: Business logic separated into focused manager classes
- **Hook Pattern**: React integration layer with custom hooks
- **Component Pattern**: Isolated, reusable UI components
- **Analytics Pattern**: Event-driven analytics with COPPA compliance

## Performance Requirements
- First Buddy payload: ‚â§ 400 KB gzipped
- Subsequent Buddies: ‚â§ 300 KB each
- Accessory PNG: ‚â§ 256 KB
- Voice line MP3: 48 kbps mono, ‚â§ 30 KB per line

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Git Commands
```bash
git status           # Check working tree status
git add .            # Stage all changes
git commit -m "msg"  # Commit with message
git push             # Push to GitHub (authentication configured)
git pull             # Pull latest changes from GitHub
```

### Testing & Demo
```bash
# ‚úÖ WORKING RIVE INTEGRATION:
# Navigate to localhost:3000 ‚Üí "Rive Animation Test" tab
# Check "Use Rive Animation" checkbox
# Click kitten ninja to trigger wave gesture animation
# 
# Features working:
# - Real Rive character rendering (kitten-ninja.riv)
# - Dynamic canvas sizing from artboard dimensions
# - Wave gesture animation with user interaction
# - CDN-based Rive loading (bypasses webpack issues)
# - Proper error handling and fallbacks
```

### Testing
```bash
npm run test         # Run unit tests with Vitest
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui      # Open Vitest UI
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript compiler check
npm run format       # Format with Prettier
# Note: ESLint configuration needs adjustment for this setup
```

## Key Goals & Metrics
- Increase weekly active reading sessions by 15%
- Increase median consecutive reading days by 3 days
- 5+ buddy interaction events per user per week
- 60% of users equip at least 1 accessory
- 70% of new users hatch a buddy within Day 1

## Accessibility Requirements
- Motion reduction support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
- Screen reader support with ARIA-live announcements
- Keyboard/switch control navigation
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Audio transcripts available

## COPPA Compliance
- Hashed user IDs
- Hourly analytics batching
- Parental consent gates

## Phase Roadmap
- **‚úÖ v0.1 Foundation (COMPLETED)**: Rive integration, kitten ninja character, wave gesture animation, GitHub setup
- **üîÑ v0.2 (IN PROGRESS)** - Character Reusability: Multi-artboard architecture for efficient character variations
- **v0.3 (NEXT)** - Additional animations: Add idle, happy, sad gestures in Rive Editor
- **v0.4** - State machines: Complex animation logic and transitions
- **v0.5** - Audio integration: Voice lines synchronized with gestures
- **v1.0** - Full buddy system: Multi-buddy unlock, accessories, analytics

## üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY: Character Reusability Architecture
**Goal**: Implement single .riv file with multiple artboards for 70-80% file size reduction
**Progress**: Research completed, implementation plan approved
**Next Steps**:
1. **Create humanoid-buddies.riv** - Single file with multiple character artboards
2. **Update RiveBuddy component** to support artboard switching
3. **Enhance BuddyManager** for character variation handling
4. **Update type definitions** for multi-character support
5. **Performance testing** - Verify file size and switching speed improvements

## Character Reusability Benefits (Research Findings)
- **File Size**: Single 400KB file vs multiple 300KB+ files per character
- **Performance**: Instant character switching (no network requests)
- **Maintainability**: Shared bone structure and animations across all characters
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new character variations
