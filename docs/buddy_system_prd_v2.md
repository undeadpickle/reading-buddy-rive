# Buddy System for Kids Reading App - PRD v2.0

**Product Manager:** Travis Gregory - Principal Product Designer  
**Engineering Lead:** Claude AI Assistant  
**Last Updated:** July 1, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Ready  

## Executive Summary

The Buddy System is an interactive companion feature for our web-based kids' reading platform. Children hatch, befriend, and customize animated "Buddies" powered by Rive animations. These digital companions react to reading progress, celebrate achievements, and evolve through unlockable accessories, creating a motivational feedback loop between reading effort and immediate rewards.

## Goals & Success Metrics

| Goal | KPI | Target |
|------|-----|---------|
| Increase reading frequency | Weekly Active Reading Sessions | +15% within 6 weeks |
| Strengthen retention | Median consecutive reading days | +3 days over control |
| Drive engagement | Buddy interactions per user per week | >= 5 events |
| Encourage customization | Users who equip accessories | 60% |
| Feature adoption | New users who hatch a buddy | 70% within Day 1 |

*Metrics tracked via custom analytics with COPPA compliance*

## User Personas

| Persona | Age | Use Case | Buddy Behavior |
|---------|-----|----------|----------------|
| Independent Reader Isaac | 9 | Solo reading after school | Fast animations, casual voice lines |
| Guided Reader Gia | 7 | Bedtime reading with parent | Gentle reactions, calmer audio |
| Classroom Reader Carlos | 8 | Silent reading on Chromebook | Reduced motion, visual feedback only |

```

### Data Flow
1. **App Initialization**: RiveProvider sets up Context, managers load cached data
2. **User Interaction**: Hooks trigger manager methods via Context dependency injection
3. **Progress Updates**: EggManager tracks milestones, emits hatch events
4. **Buddy Rendering**: BuddyCanvas loads Rive artboards, handles gesture inputs
5. **Audio Sync**: AudioManager plays voice lines with accessibility announcements
6. **Analytics**: Event batching with privacy-compliant data collection

### Key APIs

```typescript
// Core enums and types
enum Gesture {
  Wave = "wave",
  Jump = "jump", 
  Cheer = "cheer",
  Sad = "sad"
}

// React hook integration
const { 
  buddyConfig, 
  triggerGesture, 
  equipAccessory 
} = useBuddy()

const { 
  progressPercentage, 
  isReadyToHatch, 
  hatchEgg 
} = useEggProgress({ buddyId: 'kitten-ninja' })
```

## Performance Requirements

| Asset Type | Size Limit | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Initial Buddy Bundle | <= 400 KB gzipped | Core artboard + common animations |
| Additional Buddies | <= 300 KB each | Lazy-loaded on demand |
| Accessory Images | <= 256 KB | WebP format preferred |
| Voice Lines | <= 30 KB each | 48 kbps mono MP3 |

### Optimization Strategy
- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy + Suspense for buddy components
- **Asset Lazy Loading**: Intersection Observer for viewport-based loading
- **Memory Management**: Proper Rive cleanup and Context-based state
- **Bundle Analysis**: Vite rollup optimization with vendor chunking

## Accessibility & Compliance

### WCAG 2.2 AA Requirements
- **Motion Reduction**: Detect `prefers-reduced-motion`, fallback to static display
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA-live announcements for buddy actions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full tabbable interface, no mouse-only interactions
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 minimum ratio for all text and UI elements

### COPPA Compliance
- **Data Collection**: Hashed user IDs only, no PII storage
- **Analytics Batching**: 30-minute intervals, local storage backup
- **Parental Controls**: Consent integration for data tracking
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection, user control over features

## Content Pipeline

### Asset Creation Workflow
1. **Concept Design**: Illustrator/Figma mockups with style guide compliance
2. **Rive Animation**: Create .riv files following naming conventions
3. **Audio Production**: Record voice lines, export as 48kbps mono MP3
4. **Asset Validation**: Automated size and naming checks via CI
5. **Deployment**: CDN upload with versioning and cache busting

### Naming Conventions
- **Artboards**: PascalCase buddy IDs (e.g., `KittenNinja`)
- **State Machines**: `EmotionSM` for all buddies
- **Inputs**: Lowercase gesture names matching enum values
- **Assets**: kebab-case with buddy prefix (e.g., `kitten-ninja-hat.webp`)

## Analytics & Tracking

### Event Schema
```typescript
interface AnalyticsEvent {
  type: 'buddy_hatched' | 'gesture_triggered' | 'accessory_equipped' | 'milestone_reached'
  payload: {
    buddyId?: string
    gesture?: Gesture
    accessoryId?: string
    milestone?: string
    sessionId: string
    timestamp: number
  }
  userId?: string // Hashed identifier
}
```

### Privacy Implementation
- **Local Batching**: Events queued locally, uploaded every 30 minutes
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential metrics collected
- **User Control**: Analytics can be disabled in settings
- **Retention Limits**: Data automatically purged after 90 days

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Framework | Coverage |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Unit | Vitest | Manager classes, utility functions |
| Integration | React Testing Library | Hook behavior, component interaction |
| E2E | Playwright | Complete user flows, buddy lifecycle |
| Visual | Chromatic | Animation states, responsive design |
| Performance | Lighthouse CI | Bundle size, load times, Core Web Vitals |
| Accessibility | axe-core | WCAG compliance, screen reader support |
